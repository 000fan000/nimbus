<p>There are two recommended models for adding Nimbus to your project: as dependent libraries, or by adding the code directly to your project. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, outlined below.</p>
<h1>Add as a Dependent Library</h1>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to Nimbus' project layout won't require any maintenance on your part because the library will handle all of Nimbus' building. If a new file is added to a Nimbus library then your projects will automatically include these by nature of linking to the library.</li>
<li>Build results can be reused between multiple projects. This can lower the overall build time if you maintain multiple projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding libraries to a project can be a pain in the ass and the learning curve is steep if the automated nimbus script doesn't work for your project.</li>
<li>Finding documentation and setting breakpoints in Nimbus can be frustrating at best.</li>
<li>If you want to browse the Nimbus source you will need to keep multiple Xcode projects open. This can be very problematic in Xcode 4.</li>
<li>Headers must be protected because they get copied to a separate directory. This can be frustrating if you want to hack on Nimbus.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Add the Source Directly to your Project</h1>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging and stepping into Nimbus code is much easier when it exists directly in your project.</li>
<li>You can modify any Nimbus source file without worrying about whether the header is a copied header or the original.</li>
<li>Fewer context switches when building the library can lower build times in certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are any major modifications to Nimbus' project layout then you will have to manually update your projects.</li>
<li>If you have multiple projects then the build products won't be reused, causing some duplicate build time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Which model should I use?</h1>
<p>It's entirely up to you to weigh the above pros and cons with your own pros and cons. Based on the pros and cons listed above, it's recommended that you <b>add the source directly to your project</b>. While this will create a bit more work for you if Nimbus changes drastically down the line, the day-to-day advantages far outweigh the downside of what is realistically a rare event.</p>
<p>If you choose to use dependent libraries, please consider using the nimbus script found in nimbus/scripts/. It may be advantageous to you to add nimbus/scripts to your PATH so that you can run nimbus directly. </p>
